    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pistou is a classic provençal sauce made of basil, garlic and olive oil, similar to pesto but without the pine nuts and Parmesan. </p>
    <p>Mary's creamy, herby sauce is the perfect partner for pasta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp roughly chopped flatleaf parsley</li>
        <li>4 tbsp roughly chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp roughly snipped fresh chives</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juice only</li>
        <li>200g/7oz full-fat crème fraîche</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the pistou, blend the herbs, garlic, lemon juice and crème fraîche in a food processor until finely chopped. Season well with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the linguine in a large pan of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a deep frying pan, add the mushrooms and fry over a high heat for a few minutes. Cover with a lid for 3 minutes, remove the lid and cook off any liquid over a high heat until the mushrooms are golden brown. Spoon into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the pistou to the frying pan and bring to the boil. Add the pasta and reserved water, season with salt and pepper and toss until coated.</li>
        <li>Tip the pasta into bowls and scatter with the remaining Parmesan and mushrooms. Check the seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if necessary, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
